### The challenge

The goal of the project was to create a responsive page following the design provided by Frontend Mentor. The design included a background image that changed depending on the size of the screen, a navigation menu that transformed into a menu button when the screen was resized, and a grid layout for the different elements of the page.

The challenge required developers to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a responsive and interactive page. For this project, I opted to use CSS Grid to organize the page elements, and JavaScript to implement the background image toggle functionality.

#### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
